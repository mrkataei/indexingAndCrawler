Viveport forgoes its share of developer revenue until 2021
VR Developers with games on HTC’s Viveport storefront will receive 100 percent of their net revenue earned through the end of the year, with Viveport forgoing its platform share for the holiday season.
“Each year we look to celebrate our developer community while offering our full support during their busiest season,” writes HTC’s Vive team.
As with years prior, the deal does require developers to opt in their games to at least one of four Viveport programs (Viveport Store: One Time Purchase, Viveport Infinity Program, Viveport Arcade Program, or the Viveport In-App Purchase service).
Devs looking for more details on how to participate in the temporary program can find info over on the Vive blog.
