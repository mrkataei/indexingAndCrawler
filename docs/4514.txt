Being a filmmaker involves everything, drawing pictures, directing, so it's not only directing people.
- Tsukamoto Shinya
Since I started developing my first games, I've been following this precise concept: game-making involves everything, just as filmmaking does. Working on narrative games, I learned that writing them is like creating movies that could go deeper into the narrative, with more than one possible, linear story:
Who are those characters? How do they move or talk? What choices do they have in their daily life?
Game-making became for me a way to understand all this and led me to a deeper interest in Narrative Design and to various occasions that gave me the possibility to found Team SolEtude, a small studio now focused on the development of two visual novels: Beyond your window and Reverie.
