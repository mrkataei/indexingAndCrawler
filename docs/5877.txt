Michel M. Prins's Blog
My name is Michel M. Prins (LinkedIn), a Dutch game concept art student and currently doing my Master education at Breda University (BUAS). This is where I also graduated for my bachelor's degree in Creative Media and Game Technologies.
Before my bachelor I graduated in 2015 for my college degree in Game Artist at Alfa-College, Groningen. This is where I had my internships at Team 6 Game Studios and Promobears.
During that study I used my spare time to participate in international student animation projects. Some of these also moved on to Kickstarter projects like True Tail and Azadae.
