Beast Master - Development Update 14 - Building System
As we mentioned before, Beast Master will have a building system where players will able to build little villages and towns.
We developed a grid based system which we can adjust some values to fit any kind of terrain. We can change the grid size, terrain size, maximum height of the grid system to work and slope limit to prevent building on inclined surfaces. This runs on a very high performance system.
The system will allow to build walls, houses, marketplaces, craft stations, animal farms and many more. Also building villages will provide the player some certain craft and upgrade resources.
The enemy creatures will attack those villages from time to time. Each attack will be announced in advance and the player will be given some time to set up the defense and prepare the army to defend the village.
We hope you like this weeks blog and we are looking forward to hear for some feedback. Thanks for reading and watching.
