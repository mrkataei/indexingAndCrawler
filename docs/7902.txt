Capcom says customer information is secure following cyber attack
An unauthorized third party managed to gain access to Capcom's internal systems during a recent cyber attack, the company has confirmed.
In a brief statement, the Japanese developer-publisher explained the attack was carried out "in the early morning hours of November 2, 2002," and that it appears to have targeted both its email and file servers.
"Some of the Capcom Group networks experienced issues that affected access to certain systems, including email and file servers," reads the statement. "The company has confirmed that this was due to unauthorized access carried out by a third party, and that it has halted some operations of its internal networks as of November 2."
Capcom said there's no evidence that any customer information was breached, and that the incident didn't affect its online game systems or various websites.
It's currently working with the police and related authored to investigate the matter, and is taking measures to restore its systems. An update will be issued when more information comes to light.
