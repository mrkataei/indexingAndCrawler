EA renews UFC, NHL, NHLPA partnerships with fresh 'multi-year' deals
EA has announced "multi-year renewals" of its partnerships with the NHL, NHLPA, and UFC to allow it to continue work on the EA Sports NHL and EA Sports UFC franchises.
The extensions were announced in two separate press releases, though both essentially secure the long-term, officially licensed future of two of the publisher's major sports series.
EA's new agreement with UFC will span a decade, according to Tracey Bleczinski, SVP of UFC Global Consumer Products, and will see the pair collaborate on a range of products for a variety of platforms -- including "expanded future offerings for mobile players."
The NHL renewal, meanwhile, is simply being touted as a "multi-year" partnership that will allow the U.S. publisher to create "authentic and innovative hockey simulation experiences [...] for years to come"
