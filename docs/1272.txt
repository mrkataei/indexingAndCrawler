Mobile games set new quarterly revenue record at Konami
Konami has reported an uptick in revenue and operating profit in its Digital Entertainment segment thanks to the performance of its mobile titles.
According to the Japanese company's fiscal report for the six months ended September 2020, revenues in the segment rose by 31.8 percent year-on-year to 88.3 billion yen ($854.2 million), while operating profit increased by 65.2 percent to 30.9 billion yen ($298.9 million).
Explaining that upswing, the company explained that its mobile roster set a new quarterly revenue record, and singled out Professional Baseball Spirits A as a main growth driver.
New releases like eBaseball Pawafuru Puroyakyu 2020 and PES 2021 Season Update were also name-dropped, while Konami also praised the "continued global sales" of the Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card franchise, including its recent video game spin-off Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links.
Across the company as a whole, Konami reported total revenues of 116.07 billion yen ($1.12 billion), a year-on-year decrease of 4.1 percent, and operating profits of 21.3 billion yen ($206.1 million), representing a year on-year increase of 2.1 percent.
