Mario Mihokovic - CEO of Little Green Men Games studio from Zagreb, Croatia.
Our small dev team is behind space sandbox PC games franchise -  Starpoint Gemini, Starpoint Gemini 2, spinoff Starpoint Gemini Warlords and upcoming Starpoint Gemini 3. Last two games were released both for PC and XBOX platforms.
Starpoint Gemini 2 was in development since 2011, entered Early Access program in 2013 and was released in September 2014. Much of the game content was designed to accomodate thousands of players ideas and suggestions spawned during Early Access period.
Starpoint Gemini Warlords was released in Early Access in March 2016, while full release happened in 2017.

Following release of these games, LGM Games studio continues to design and develop new games, both in established setting and some brand new directions.
