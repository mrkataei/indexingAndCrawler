PlayStation 5 forgoes day one in-store launch as a COVID-19 precaution
The folks at PlayStation have announced that the PlayStation 5 will be exclusive to online retailers on launch day in the interest of keeping in-store foot traffic to a minimum during the current pandemic.
“Please don’t plan on camping out or lining up at your local retailer on launch day in hopes of finding a PS5 console for purchase,” reads a brief blog post from SIE’s Sid Shuman. “Be safe, stay home, and place your order online.”
Shuman notes that the decision was made in order to keep players and staff safe from COVID-19 spread, but adds that players that have already opted for in-store pickup through various retailers are free to swing by for their preorders at the retailer-designated time.
It’s a necessary precaution given the current state of the coronavirus pandemic in many parts of the world, though for many PlayStation 5 hopefuls that missed out on the chaotic preorder period, this complicates their chances of getting a console close to launch day.
