PlayStation boss suggests the 'meaningful' future of VR is still years away
PlayStation chief Jim Ryan is bullish about the mainstream potential of VR technology, including the company's own PlayStation VR (PSVR) headset -- which had sold over 5 million units as of January 2020.
During an interview with The Washington Post, Ryan explained that Sony is content to play the long game when it comes to VR, and suggested fans of the technology shouldn't expect a PSVR upgrade anytime soon.
Of course, PSVR owners can always connect their headset to the PS5 using a free adaptor dished out by Sony, but while Ryan stressed that the company "believes" in the technology, he doesn't expect it to ensnare the masses anytime soon.
"I think we’re more than a few minutes from the future of VR," commented Ryan. "PlayStation believes in VR. Sony believes in VR, and we definitely believe at some point in the future, VR will represent a meaningful component of interactive entertainment.
"Will it be this year? No. Will it be next year? No. But will it come at some stage? We believe that. And we’re very pleased with all the experience that we’ve gained with PlayStation VR, and we look [forward] to seeing where that takes us in the future.”
