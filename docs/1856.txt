Old School Runescape  breaks concurrent player record during Leagues II event
Old School Runescape has set a new record for concurrent players after over 157,000 people logged on simultaneously during the ongoing Leagues II: TrailBlazer event.
The game's lead content developer Kieren Charles broke the news on Twitter, revealing exactly 157,445 players were online concurrently.
Screenshots posted in reply suggest that number continued to surge, with another Twitter user pointing to a concurrent player count of 165,072.
The milestone comes over seven years after the title launched in February 2013, and ahead of the game's proposed Steam debut in 2021.
