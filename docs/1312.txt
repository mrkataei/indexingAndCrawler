The Lego Group helps Builder's Journey dev Light Brick go independent
The Lego Group has spun off Builder's Journey developer Light Brick Studio into an independent studio.
The company originally established Light Brick as an in-house studio, but through a "spin-out collaboration" between itself and its investment arm Lego Ventures is now allowing the developer to go independent.
To facilitate the transition and help scale the studio, Lego Ventures has also invested an undisclosed sum into the newly independent Light Brick.
Light Brick founders Karsten Lund and Mads Prahm intend to use the opportunity to "explore new digital play spaces within the LEGO idea." That means working on an array of video game project with various partners to continue "creating unique and fun digital play experiences."
"We’re very excited to be able to expand and continue our journey to create new and interesting experiences, pushing the boundaries of digital play and creativity," said Lund in a press release. "While we still feel very much connected to the LEGO family, this independence will give us space to explore the future of creative play even further."
