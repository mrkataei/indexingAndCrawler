Adam Coster is a co-founder of Butterscotch Shenanigans, where he is a general solver-of-problems, web developer, tool developer, and practicer of DevOps. Adam spends most of his time programming, usually building web infrastructure to automate and expand the capabilities of the studio. When he isn’t programming, Adam is probably using some random mishmash of science, statistics, philosophy, and psychology to help guide the studio’s business and game development decisions.
