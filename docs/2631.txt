Sponsored: How to increase your pre-order pipeline and why pre-order sales are critical
Presented by Xsolla
Pre-orders are an underutilized lifeline for game developers. The block of time before a game’s full release presents a prime opportunity for building awareness, establishing a community, forming relationships with influencers, and bringing in early-stage funding, all of which can be critical for sustaining a project during the development cycle.
Timing is important when it comes to maximizing pre-order effectiveness. Getting started early and building sufficient momentum are the keys to success. Most developers report 15-28% of their total pre-launch sales are made just on the first-day pre-orders are made available.
