Video games turned my 4-year old self playing Sonic The Hedgehog on Sega's Master System in 1991 into a video game localization expert now leading a guild of fellow veteran game translators, Level Up Translation.

Level Up Translation offers video game localization and translation services for Console, PC, browser-based, iOs and Android games into more than 20 languages including English, Russian, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Chinese, Japanese, French, Italian, German and Spanish.
Our team of freelancers has been collectively involved in several AAA and major indie games and counts years of experience at various positions of the video game industry, which gives us an acute understanding of the localization process and helps us adapt to any project for any platform.
We love video games, we believe in the magic of their words. Let us help you level up and spread the magic!
