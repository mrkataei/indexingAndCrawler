Andre Faure's Blog
I have the privilege of working in this virtuous industry for the last 22 years, always in leadership positions, from Marketing and Product Manager LATAM, XBOX to General Manager of the ZEEBO project at Tectoy/Qualcomm to Sr. Director, Games at RealNetworks. More than six years ago I have decided to invest in my own company, GamePlan, a consultancy specialized in Business Intelligence, Development and Marketing Strategy and Execution. Since 2014, we have served more than 180 studios and companies across the globe and the industry.
I'm looking forward to sharing opinions, trends, questions and hopefully a lot of information to help out readers!
