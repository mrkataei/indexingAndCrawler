Sony launches PS5 remote play app for the PS4 with next-gen looming
Sony has quietly launched a PlayStation 5 remote play app for the PlayStation 4 ahead of the next-gen console's United States launch on November 12.
As spotted by Eurogamer, the PS5 Remote Play app has been automatically added to the PS4 dashboard, and lets PS4 owners use the console to control their PS5 over the Internet.
On paper, the app gives users the option to stream games at 540p, 720p, and 1080p resolutions, although because the app is currently unable to be tested with a PS5, it's unclear whether its possible to actually play next-gen titles on the PS4 via Remote Play using the DualShock gamepad.
With the PS5, Sony is introducing a new controller called the DuelSense that boasts additional features including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Because of those upgrades, Sony ultimately decided against making the DualShock forward-compatible with next-gen titles -- casting doubt on how exactly it could be used to play PS5 titles via streaming on the PS4.
