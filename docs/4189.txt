EA Play crosses 6.5 million paying subscribers
Electronic Arts’s freshly rebranded subscription game library EA Play has officially crossed 6.5 million paying subscribers since EA introduced the program as EA Access six years back.
That 6.5 million represents a major push from EA to give its digital services suite a fresh coat of paint and make the EA Play subscription in particular enticing for as many players as possible through recent expansions onto Steam and even a coming teamup with Xbox.
For comparison’s sake, that 6.5 million is about half as many subscribers as Xbox’s own game subscription service, Xbox Game Pass, currently boasts but the two brands are working on a partnership to roll EA Play into the Game Pass Ultimate subscription.
