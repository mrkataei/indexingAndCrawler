REDMOND, WA – November 9, 2020 – This past weekend, Studio Wildcard hosted its Extra Life 24-hour charity stream and with the help of the ARK community, sponsors and ExtraLife team, they placed Top 4 globally and raised over $180,000 for children in need (which beat all of their past records)! During Extra Life the Wildcard team shared sneak peeks at upcoming content including visuals from the upcoming ARK: Genesis Part II Expansion Pack - check it out!
In the opening moments, an ARK: Genesis Part II teaser trailer was revealed introducing dramatic new biomes, story missions, and exotic creatures coming when it launches March 2021. The highly anticipated expansion pack also introduces new voiceover talent to the ARK universe with David Tennant (Doctor Who, Good Omens) playing the villainous Sir Edmund Rockwell, and Madeleine Madden (The Wheel of Time, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dora and the Lost City of Gold) taking on the in-game robotic AI companion HLN-A/Helena Walker.
The next trailer reveal, put a spotlight on the TLC Pass #3 update which brings new abilities and visual refinements for the Stegosaurus and Woolly Mammoth, along with the addition of insect and wyvern breeding, the taming HUD, and more!
